## Objective

- The objective of this project was to create a robust and scalable movie ticket booking application, similar to BookMyShow, using Spring Boot, Maven, and MySQL.
- The focus was on implementing a reliable backend system with efficient data handling, enhanced security, and optimized user experience through real-world booking scenarios.

## Outcomes

- Robust Backend Development: Successfully engineered the backend system using Spring Boot and MySQL, following the MVC architecture to ensure clean separation of concerns and scalable code structure.
- Improved Developer Efficiency: Reduced developer workload by approximately 30% through the use of Jpa Repository extensions, streamlining database interactions.
- Efficient Data Handling: Enhanced backend abstraction by over 23% using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), ensuring efficient and accurate data delivery to end-users.
- Optimized User Experience: Implemented features such as show booking, leveraging real-world booking scenarios to provide an intuitive and seamless user experience.
- Concurrency Management: Addressed concurrency challenges by implementing user-specific locks, which eliminated functionality ambiguities or malfunctions, leading to a 30% improvement in user interaction.
- Enhanced Security: Strengthened security measures for user sign-up and login processes by utilizing Bcrypt Generator and Spring Security, ensuring secure password encryption and reducing vulnerability to cyber threats.

## Key Technologies
